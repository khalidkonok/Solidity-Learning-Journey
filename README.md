# Solidity Learning Journey

Welcome to my Solidity Learning Journey! 🚀

This repository contains all my learning projects and experiments with Solidity, the programming language for Ethereum smart contracts.  
My goal is to **learn by building real-life style contracts** and eventually develop professional-grade decentralized applications (dApps).

---

## 🛠️ Learning Goals

1. Understand **Solidity basics**: state variables, functions, data types, operators.  
2. Build **practical contracts** that simulate real-world use cases.  
3. Learn **smart contract best practices**: visibility, security, gas optimization.  
4. Prepare for **client-ready projects** and freelance opportunities in blockchain development.  



## 💡 Current Projects

- **PiggyBank.sol** – A simple smart contract to practice deposits, withdrawals, and balance checks.  
- **Calculator.sol** – Pure functions to perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.  
- **CounterMachine.sol** – A counter that can be increased or decreased with input values.  
- **VotingMachine.sol** – A mini-voting contract to practice state variables and functions.

*(More projects coming as I progress!)*

## 🔑 Key Learning Concepts Covered

- State variables & data types  
- Functions: input, output, view, pure, payable  
- Visibility: public, private, internal, external  
- Require statements & basic error handling  
- Gas costs & optimization considerations  
- Basic contract deployment and interaction

## 📌 Notes

This repo is **not production-ready** yet; it’s a learning journey.  
All projects are written in **Solidity ^0.8.15** and tested in **Remix IDE**.

## ⚡ Next Steps

- Implement **multi-user PiggyBank**  
- Learn **events and logging**  
- Explore **mapping and structs**  
- Build a small **dApp frontend** with Web3.js or Ethers.js
